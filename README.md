# Spring Multithreading Project

Welcome to the Spring Multithreading Project. This project demonstrates multi-threading concepts within a Spring Boot application.

## Important Notice: Lombok Dependency Issue

When setting up this project, you might encounter an issue related to Lombok, where methods generated by Lombok annotations (like `@Getter`, `@Setter`) are not recognized during compilation or when starting the server. This can lead to errors like `java: cannot find symbol` even though the code seems correct in your IDE.

### Solution

To resolve this issue, ensure that you include the Lombok dependency in your `pom.xml` before building the project for the first time or before starting the server. Here is the dependency you should add:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
    <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
    <version>1.18.20</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```


Note: This dependency was added to this project from the very beginning to avoid such issues. If you're creating a new project, make sure to include this dependency right after project creation.

Additional Steps
IDE Configuration: If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, ensure that annotation processing is enabled:
Go to Preferences > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Annotation Processors and check "Enable annotation processing".
Lombok Plugin: Install the Lombok plugin if your IDE supports it to improve Lombok annotation recognition.

Project Setup
To set up this project:

Clone the repository.
Ensure Maven is installed and configured.
Run mvn clean install to build the project.
Start the application with ``` mvn spring-boot:run ``` or through your IDE.
