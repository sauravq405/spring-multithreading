# Javadoc Spring Boot Fix - Challenges and Solutions

## 1. Issue Overview
The user is working on a Spring Boot application and attempting to generate Javadoc documentation. However, they encountered issues related to Javadoc not being generated correctly despite having the right dependencies in the `pom.xml`.

### Main Issues:
- Javadoc not generating despite correct dependencies.
- Errors related to missing comments in the code.
- Difficulty suppressing warnings related to missing Javadoc comments.
- Attempted to resolve issues with `mvn clean javadoc:javadoc` but failed.

## 2. Commands Suggested and Executed

### 2.1 Checking Dependencies:
- Command to check the dependencies and confirm the resolution:
  ```bash
  mvn dependency:build-classpath -DincludeScope=compile
  ```

### 2.2 Dependency Tree:
- Command to print the entire dependency tree of the project:
  ```bash
  mvn dependency:tree
  ```

### 2.3 Clean Javadoc Generation Command:
- Command to attempt generating Javadoc:
  ```bash
  mvn clean javadoc:javadoc
  ```

## 3. Challenges Encountered

### 3.1 Missing Javadoc Comments:
The user encountered warnings for classes and methods without comments, causing the Javadoc process to fail. The following errors were reported:
```text
[ERROR] /src/main/java/com/mt/demo/service/executables/ThreadYielder.java:5: warning: no comment
[ERROR] public class ThreadYielder extends Thread{
[ERROR]        ^
[ERROR] 3 errors
[ERROR] 35 warnings
```

### 3.2 Suppressing Warnings:
User wanted to suppress the warnings and continue generating Javadoc even for classes with no comments. However, Maven reported errors about invalid configurations when attempting to use the following elements:
```xml
<showWarnings>false</showWarnings>
<showMissingJavadocTags>false</showMissingJavadocTags>
<additionalparam>-Xdoclint:none</additionalparam>
```

## 4. Solutions and Fixes

### 4.1 Suppress Javadoc Warnings
The correct way to suppress warnings and doclint issues is by using the `additionalJOptions` in the plugin configuration:
```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-javadoc-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.4.1</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>javadoc</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <destDir>${project.basedir}/docs</destDir> <!-- Set output directory to ./docs -->
                <additionalJOptions>
                    <additionalJOption>-Xdoclint:none</additionalJOption> <!-- Ignore doclint -->
                </additionalJOptions>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```
- The key configuration is using `<additionalJOptions>` with the `-Xdoclint:none` option.
- Output is directed to the `./docs` directory.

### 4.2 Validations:
- Ensure that the plugin version is correct (`3.4.1`).
- Use the `${project.basedir}/docs` variable to specify the output directory as `./docs`.

## 5. Additional Considerations
- **Maven Version Compatibility**: Ensure you are using Maven 3.8 or later for better compatibility with certain plugins.
- **Javadoc Compliance**: Be mindful that, even though warnings can be suppressed, it is still a good practice to include Javadoc comments in your code.

## 6. Conclusion
By updating the Maven Javadoc Plugin configuration to include `-Xdoclint:none`, the user successfully generated Javadoc documentation while suppressing warnings for missing comments. The final output is placed in the location`./docs` directory.
